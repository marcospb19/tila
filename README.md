Single file keylogger I wrote that uses xinput to listen to my keyboard and write all press keycodes into a log file.

This was used to help me analyze my input with this tool:

keyboard-layout-analyzer is a program to compare different keyboard layouts using some input you give, so it can classify the effectiveness of each layout if you were to type the input text using them.
